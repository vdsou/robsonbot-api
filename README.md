# Hey, there

This project is **Robson** Project, a discord bot who can do some simple things,
which make me and my friends happy while hanging on discord.

## He can

- Play fun audios;
- Show a scoreboard;
- Say some cool and fun messages on text channel;
- Show some cute kitty cat images.

Most of the commands are stored in a MongoDB database.
I decided to split the project into two main peaces:

- An **API** which its endpoints are going to be consumed by Robson own webpage, like his frontend and also the Bot himself.
- A **discord Bot** build in Javascript along with discord.js which is a powerful Node.js module that allows you to interact with the Discord API very easily.
